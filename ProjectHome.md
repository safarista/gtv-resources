## Google TV Optimized Templates ##

To make website optimization for TV easier, we are providing templates - 2 in HTML5 and 2 in Flash - that developers can download and modify with their own content and style. The HTML5 and Flash templates are identical and meant to work the same way.

The HTML5 version of these templates are utilizing the [Google TV UI library](http://code.google.com/p/gtv-ui-lib). The Google TV Web UI library contains 2 versions to suit various web developers needs; jQuery based and Closure based. The UI library can be used independent of the templates.

The Flash templates includes a small library of controls. The source of this library is included in the downloadable zip files and can be modified as needed.

Here are live examples of the templates:
  * [Template 1](http://gtv-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/templates/html-01/index.html)
  * [Template 2](http://gtv-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/templates/html-02/index.html)

To proceed with the HTML5 templates, [download the zip file](http://code.google.com/p/gtv-resources/downloads/list) you want and read the [HTML5 Template Starter Guide](http://code.google.com/p/gtv-resources/wiki/HTML5TemplateStarterGuide).

For Flash templates, [download the zip file you want](http://code.google.com/p/gtv-resources/downloads/list) and read the [Flash Template Starter Guide](http://code.google.com/p/gtv-resources/wiki/FlashTemplateStarterGuide).
